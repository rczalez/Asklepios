# Asklepios - Therapy software for people with osteoarthritis in hands.
![Logo Image Asklepios](/Images/logo.png)
As a complement to conventional hand therapy performed by a therapist, Asklepios is a prototype designed for people with osteoarthritis. The exercises typically performed during therapy are now monitored using a Kinect V2 sensor, along with the Project Gesture SDK, which enables the creation of custom gestures. This approach offers a new opportunity to increase patient engagement throughout each session.

<b>What we're using to create Asklepios?</b>:

<b>Kinect Sensor V2</b>

<p>Kinect is Microsoft‚Äôs motion sensor add-on for the Xbox 360 and Xbox One gaming console. The device provides a natural user interface (NUI) that allows users to interact intuitively and without any intermediary device, such as a controller. Although Kinect was developed for playing games, the technology has been applied to real-world applications and showed up potential uses through the years in areas such as physical therapy, interfaces for sterile environments like operating rooms, and fitness.</p>

<b>Project Gesture SDK(formerly Project Prague)</b>

</p><br>

<p>Project Gesture is a cutting-edge, easy-to-use SDK that creates more intuitive and natural experiences by allowing users to control and interact with technologies through hand gestures. Based on extensive research, it equips developers and UX designers with the ability to quickly design and implement customized hand gestures into their apps.

<p>The project is being supported by the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CEPROFIS/" target="_blank">"Centro Profesional de Fisioterapia (CEPROFIS)"</a>:</p>

Passioned and ambitious about create technology for Healthcare purposes, maybe you can say: "it is not an easy path for someone with a background in tech without experience in Healthcare"(I know...), but that's the main reason why I have a steady source of motivation that drives me to put all my efforts on it, because..., "if everything was easy to do, nothing would be worth it" üòâ.

<p>More coming soon ‚úåÔ∏è! In addition, we're working in a blog üíª to share videos üìπ and information üì∞ about Project Asklepios, so keep up to date to see the progress of the prototype!</p>
